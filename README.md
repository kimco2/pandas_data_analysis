# Introduction to Pandas

 ### **Overview**
An early project undertaken to understand how to manipulate and analyse data in Pandas. School and standardised test data was analysed and trends in school performance noted.

### **Folder structure**
The folder *PyCitySchools* has two files:
 - *Script.ipynb* - contains the analysis and output
 - *Results_Summary.docx* - written summary of the results

### **Findings**
When looking at the overall results for the 15 schools in the local government area:
•	The average maths and reading scores are similar (70.3 and 70.0 respectively).
•	Slightly more students are passing maths (at 86%) than reading (at 84%).
•	The percentage passing both maths and reading sits lower at 73%.

Aspects that can impact a school’s performance are:
 - School size, with small and medium schools (less than 2,000 students) outperforming large schools (with 2,000 to 5,000 students). The difference is most notable in terms of the percentage passing maths, reading, and both.
    - At small schools 79% of students are passing both maths and reading, 78% at medium schools, compared with 70% at large schools.

 - School type, with independent schools performing better than government schools, notably in relation to the percentage passing maths, reading, and both. 
    - Independent schools have 77% passing both maths and reading, while government schools have 71%.

 - The amount a school spends per student, as spending more does not result in better learning outcomes. School performance is strongest when a school spends less than $630 per student. With the spending range $585-630 producing the best performance.
    - For schools spending is $585-630 per student, 80% of students are passing both maths and reading, compared with 67% passing for schools spending $645-680 per student.
